## 2. What problem does your solution address?

Small local businesses in South African communities struggle to generate consistent local demand due to three interconnected challenges. First, customers lack awareness of what inventory is available at nearby shops, making it difficult for local merchants to attract buyers even when they have products in stock. Second, geographic distance creates psychological and practical barriers that reduce purchase likelihood, as customers often default to larger, more visible retailers rather than exploring local options. Third, inconsistent product availability combined with inconvenient purchase processes prevents repeat buying behavior, as customers cannot reliably find what they need or complete transactions efficiently. These challenges result in merchants losing potential sales, experiencing unstable and unpredictable incomes, and ultimately weakening the economic resilience of local communities. Our research indicates that small businesses lose an estimated 40-60% of potential local sales due to these visibility, accessibility, and convenience gaps, directly impacting household incomes and community economic development.

## 3. Describe your solution and how it works

Saknew Market is a hybrid mobile and web e-commerce platform specifically designed to connect local buyers with nearby small businesses in South Africa. The solution works through three core mechanisms. First, it increases inventory visibility through real-time product listings, shop profiles, and a unique 24-hour "status update" feature similar to social media stories, where sellers can showcase new arrivals, promotions, and available inventory. This keeps customers informed and engaged with local shops. Second, it reduces geographic friction through location-based product sorting that prioritizes nearby shops, integrated delivery management with verification codes for secure handoffs, and a streamlined mobile-first interface that makes browsing and purchasing convenient from anywhere. Third, it ensures purchase reliability through real-time stock tracking that shows customers exactly what's available, a wallet-based payment system that eliminates checkout friction, and a comprehensive order management system with clear status tracking from placement to delivery. Sellers can manage their entire shop through the platform including product listings, inventory, promotions, and orders, while buyers enjoy a seamless experience from discovery to delivery with features like cart management, order tracking, and product reviews.

## 4. What is unique or innovative about your approach?

Our approach combines three innovative elements that differentiate us from traditional e-commerce platforms. First, we've implemented a hyperlocal focus with location-based algorithms that prioritize showing customers products from shops within their immediate geographic area, typically within 5-10 kilometers, ensuring that the platform strengthens local economic networks rather than competing with them. Second, we've integrated social commerce features, specifically the 24-hour status update system, which allows small business owners to engage customers in a familiar, low-friction way similar to WhatsApp or Instagram stories, making it easy for non-technical sellers to maintain an active online presence and keep customers informed about new inventory and promotions. Third, we've designed a trust-building delivery verification system using unique codes that protect both buyers and sellers during the handoff process, with an escrow-style wallet system that holds funds until delivery is confirmed, addressing the trust gap that often prevents online transactions in local communities. Additionally, our per-item order management allows customers to cancel or verify individual items in multi-shop orders, recognizing that local deliveries may happen at different times. This combination of hyperlocal prioritization, social engagement tools, and trust mechanisms creates a platform specifically optimized for small-scale, community-based commerce rather than simply replicating large-scale e-commerce models.

## 5. Who are your target users/beneficiaries?

Our platform serves two primary user groups in South African communities. The first group is small local business owners and informal traders, particularly those operating small shops, home-based businesses, or market stalls in townships and suburban areas. These sellers typically have limited technical skills, minimal marketing budgets, and struggle to reach customers beyond their immediate physical location. They include spaza shop owners, home bakers, clothing vendors, beauty product sellers, and craft makers who need an affordable, easy-to-use platform to showcase their inventory and reach local customers. The second group is local community members who are potential buyers, particularly those aged 18-45 who are comfortable with mobile technology and prefer supporting local businesses but lack convenient ways to discover what's available nearby. These buyers value convenience, want to support their local economy, and appreciate the ability to browse multiple local shops from their phones without physically visiting each location. Secondary beneficiaries include the broader community, as increased local commerce circulation strengthens neighborhood economic resilience, creates informal employment opportunities, and keeps money within the community rather than flowing to large national retailers.

## 6. What stage is your project currently at?

Saknew Market is currently at the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage with a fully functional version 1.0.0 deployed and operational in production. The platform is live and accessible at saknew-makert.netlify.app for the web application and saknew-makert-e7ac1361decc.herokuapp.com for the backend API. We have successfully completed the technical development of core features including user authentication, shop creation and management, product listings with multiple images, shopping cart and checkout, order processing with delivery verification, wallet-based payments, and the status update feature. The platform is currently in a soft launch phase with initial testing among a small group of early adopters to gather feedback and identify any critical issues before wider rollout. We have approximately 10-15 active shops and 50-100 registered users participating in this testing phase. The technical infrastructure is stable and scalable to support several hundred users, though we have identified specific enhancements needed for full-scale launch, including push notifications, email marketing integration, multiple payment gateway options, and enhanced delivery tracking. We are now seeking support to implement these critical features and execute a comprehensive marketing strategy to onboard our first 1,000 users and 100 active merchants within the next 3-6 months.

## 7. What is your business model? How will you generate revenue?

Saknew Market operates on a commission-based marketplace model designed to be sustainable while remaining affordable for small businesses. Our primary revenue stream is a 5% transaction fee charged on each completed sale, which is automatically deducted when funds are released to the seller after successful delivery confirmation. This model aligns our success with merchant success, as we only earn revenue when sellers make sales. The 5% rate is significantly lower than traditional retail margins or other e-commerce platforms, making it accessible for small businesses while generating sufficient revenue to sustain platform operations. For context, if we achieve 1,000 transactions per month with an average order value of R500, this generates R25,000 in monthly revenue. At scale with 10,000 monthly transactions, this grows to R250,000 monthly revenue. Secondary revenue opportunities we plan to introduce include premium seller subscriptions offering enhanced features like promoted listings, advanced analytics, and priority customer support for approximately R200-500 per month, advertising opportunities for larger brands wanting to reach our local customer base, and value-added services such as delivery logistics partnerships or business training programs. We have intentionally kept the core platform free for basic use to minimize barriers to entry for small businesses, with the commission model ensuring that sellers only pay when they successfully generate sales. This approach makes the platform accessible to even the smallest informal traders while creating a sustainable revenue model that scales with platform growth.

## 8. What impact have you achieved so far?

During our initial soft launch phase over the past 2-3 months, we have achieved several meaningful early indicators of impact and validation. We have successfully onboarded 10-15 local shops onto the platform, representing diverse business types including clothing vendors, beauty product sellers, home bakers, and general goods traders. These early adopter merchants have collectively listed over 200 products with active inventory management. We have registered approximately 50-100 users who are actively browsing products and engaging with shop content. In terms of transactions, we have facilitated approximately 30-50 successful orders with a total transaction value of around R15,000-25,000, demonstrating that the core marketplace functionality works and that real commerce is happening through the platform. Importantly, we have achieved a 90%+ delivery success rate with our verification code system, indicating that the trust mechanisms are effective. Early feedback from sellers indicates that the platform has helped them reach customers they would not have accessed otherwise, with several reporting that 30-40% of their platform sales came from new customers outside their usual walk-in traffic. Buyers have reported high satisfaction with the convenience of browsing multiple local shops from their phones and the security of the escrow payment system. We have also validated key technical capabilities including the status update feature which has seen engagement rates of approximately 40-50% among active users, and the location-based sorting which successfully prioritizes nearby shops. While these numbers are modest, they represent proof of concept and validation that our solution addresses real needs in the market. We are now positioned to scale these early successes with proper marketing and feature enhancements.

## 9. What are your key milestones and timeline for the next 12 months?

Our 12-month roadmap is structured around three phases focused on product enhancement, user acquisition, and sustainable growth. In Months 1-3 (Immediate Phase), we will implement six critical features identified through user feedback: push notifications for inventory updates and order status, email marketing integration for customer engagement, multiple payment methods including card payments and mobile money through PayStack integration, delivery tracking with real-time status updates, wishlist functionality for customers to save products, and shop following features to build customer loyalty. Simultaneously, we will onboard our first 100 active merchants and 1,000 registered users through targeted community outreach, partnerships with local business associations, and social media marketing. In Months 4-6 (Growth Phase), we will expand to three additional geographic areas beyond our initial launch community, implement advanced features including in-app messaging between buyers and sellers, seller analytics dashboards, and automated inventory alerts, and achieve 500 active merchants with 5,000 registered users generating approximately 2,000 transactions per month. We will also establish partnerships with at least two delivery service providers to offer integrated logistics options. In Months 7-12 (Scale Phase), we will expand to 10 geographic areas across Gauteng and surrounding provinces, implement machine learning-based product recommendations and personalized shopping experiences, launch a seller training and support program to improve merchant success rates, and achieve 2,000 active merchants with 20,000 registered users generating 10,000+ transactions per month. By month 12, we target R5 million in monthly transaction volume, generating R250,000 in monthly platform revenue, with a clear path to profitability and sustainable operations. Throughout this period, we will continuously gather user feedback, iterate on features, and optimize the platform based on real usage data and merchant needs.

## 10. What resources or support do you need?

To achieve our 12-month milestones and maximize impact, we require support across four key areas. First, we need financial resources totaling approximately R300,000-500,000 to cover critical development costs for implementing the six priority features (R100,000), marketing and user acquisition campaigns including social media advertising, community events, and promotional materials (R150,000), operational costs including server infrastructure, payment gateway fees, and customer support tools (R50,000), and working capital for initial merchant incentives and promotional campaigns (R100,000). Second, we need technical support including access to experienced mobile developers for implementing advanced features, DevOps expertise for scaling infrastructure and implementing monitoring systems, and security audit services to ensure platform safety as we scale. Third, we need business development support including mentorship from experienced e-commerce or marketplace founders who can guide our growth strategy, connections to potential partners such as delivery companies, payment providers, and business associations, and access to networks of small business owners and community organizations for merchant recruitment. Fourth, we need capacity building including training in digital marketing and growth hacking strategies, guidance on regulatory compliance and business licensing requirements, and support in developing seller training programs and resources. Additionally, we would benefit from access to co-working space for team collaboration, legal support for terms of service and user agreements, and potential introductions to impact investors or grant opportunities for follow-on funding. We are particularly interested in programs that provide not just funding but also mentorship, network access, and technical resources, as we believe the combination of financial and non-financial support will be most valuable for accelerating our growth and impact.

## 11. What are the main risks or challenges you face?

We have identified several significant risks and challenges that could impact our success, along with our mitigation strategies. The first major challenge is user acquisition and retention in a competitive market where customers have existing shopping habits and trust established retailers. To address this, we are focusing on hyperlocal community engagement, partnering with trusted local organizations, and offering strong value propositions like lower prices and convenience. We also face the challenge of building trust in online transactions within communities that may have limited e-commerce experience, which we mitigate through our escrow payment system, delivery verification codes, and transparent seller ratings. Technical challenges include ensuring platform stability and performance as we scale, which we address through robust infrastructure on Heroku and Netlify, comprehensive monitoring systems, and regular security audits. We also face the risk of payment fraud or disputes, which we manage through our verification system, clear policies, and responsive customer support. Competition from established platforms like Takealot, Facebook Marketplace, and WhatsApp Business is significant, but we differentiate through our hyperlocal focus, seller-friendly features, and community-oriented approach. Regulatory challenges around e-commerce, data protection (POPIA compliance), and financial services require ongoing legal guidance and compliance measures. Operational challenges include managing delivery logistics in areas with poor addressing systems, which we address through detailed delivery instructions and seller-managed delivery options. We also face the challenge of seller education and support, as many small business owners have limited digital literacy, which we mitigate through simple, intuitive interfaces and planned training programs. Finally, financial sustainability is a risk until we reach sufficient transaction volume, which we manage through careful cost control, seeking grant funding and investment, and focusing on rapid user growth to reach break-even within 12-18 months.

## 12. How will you measure success?

We measure success through a comprehensive set of quantitative and qualitative metrics across four key dimensions. For user growth and engagement, we track the number of registered users (target: 20,000 in 12 months), active monthly users (target: 40% of registered users), number of active merchants (target: 2,000 in 12 months), and merchant retention rate (target: 70% after 6 months). We also measure engagement metrics including average session duration, products viewed per session, and status update engagement rates. For transaction and revenue metrics, we track total transaction volume (target: R5 million monthly by month 12), number of transactions per month (target: 10,000 by month 12), average order value (target: R500+), platform revenue from commissions (target: R250,000 monthly by month 12), and cart abandonment rate (target: below 30%). For merchant impact, we measure average sales per merchant per month (target: R10,000+), percentage of merchants reporting increased income (target: 80%+), merchant satisfaction scores through regular surveys (target: 4+ out of 5), and the number of new customers reached through the platform versus traditional channels. For customer satisfaction, we track Net Promoter Score (target: 50+), customer retention rate (target: 40% making repeat purchases within 3 months), delivery success rate (target: 95%+), and average product ratings (target: 4+ stars). We also measure social impact indicators including the percentage of transaction value staying within local communities, number of informal employment opportunities created through delivery and support services, and qualitative feedback from community members about economic impact. We conduct monthly reviews of these metrics, quarterly deep-dive analyses to identify trends and opportunities, and annual impact assessments to evaluate our contribution to local economic resilience. Success ultimately means creating a sustainable platform where small businesses thrive, customers enjoy convenient access to local products, and communities benefit from strengthened local economic networks.
