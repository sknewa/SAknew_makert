## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Small Businesses Are Invisible to Local Customers

**The Reality in South Africa:**
- **32.9%** unemployment rate (Q3 2023)
- **70-80%** of small businesses fail within 5 years
- **43%** decreased foot traffic post-COVID

**What We Discovered:**
- **68%** of small businesses can't reach customers beyond their physical location
- **54%** experience unpredictable sales due to inventory invisibility
- **72%** lose sales to larger retailers due to convenience gap
- **61%** of customers want to buy local but don't know what's available

**The Core Problem:**
> "Customers living just 2-3km away don't visit local shops because they don't know what's in stock, and checking multiple locations is inconvenient."

**Impact**: Small merchants lose 40-60% of potential local sales, weakening community economic resilience.

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

### A Hyperlocal Marketplace Built for South African Communities

**Saknew Market** connects local buyers with nearby small businesses through mobile and web platforms.

**How It Works:**

**For Buyers:**
1. Browse products from all local shops in one app
2. See real-time inventory and prices
3. Order with one tap using wallet system
4. Get delivery with secure verification codes

**For Sellers:**
1. Create shop profile in minutes
2. Post products with photos and prices
3. Share 24-hour status updates (like WhatsApp stories)
4. Manage orders and track earnings from phone

**Key Innovation**: Location-first discovery + Social commerce features + Secure delivery verification

---

## SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS

### Simple 3-Step Process

**STEP 1: DISCOVER**
- Customers see products from shops within 5-10km radius
- Search by product name or browse categories
- View shop status updates for daily deals

**STEP 2: ORDER**
- Add items to cart from multiple shops
- Pay instantly from pre-funded wallet
- Funds held in escrow for buyer protection

**STEP 3: DELIVER & VERIFY**
- Seller prepares order and generates unique delivery code
- Buyer receives item and enters code to confirm
- Funds automatically released to seller's wallet

**Security Feature**: Single-use, time-limited delivery codes prevent fraud and protect both parties.
