# Order Cancellation Enhancement - Deployment Summary

## Date: 2025
## Feature: Enhanced Order Cancellation with 12-Hour Time Limit and Cancellation Reason

---

## Backend Changes (Deployed to Heroku)

### 1. Database Model Update
**File**: `saknew_backend/sales/models.py`
- Added `cancellation_reason` field to Order model
  - Type: TextField (max 500 characters)
  - Nullable: Yes
  - Purpose: Store user-provided reason for order cancellation

### 2. Backend Logic Enhancement
**File**: `saknew_backend/sales/views.py`
- Updated `cancel_order` action in `OrderStatusUpdateAPIView`:
  - **Cancellation Reason Validation**: Required field, returns error if empty
  - **12-Hour Time Limit**: Server-side validation prevents cancellations after 12 hours
  - **Order Status Validation**: Prevents cancellation of shipped/delivered/completed orders
  - **Automatic Refund**: Existing logic maintained (wallet refund, stock reversion, escrow updates)

### 3. Migration
**File**: `saknew_backend/sales/migrations/0005_order_cancellation_reason.py`
- Created and applied migration for new field
- Successfully deployed to Heroku production database

### 4. Backend Deployment

  - Maintains backward compatibility for other actions (verification codes)
