# Saknew Market - Lean Business Canvas

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

According to the South African Quarterly Labour Force Survey (Q3 2023), the unemployment rate stands at 32.9%, with informal sector employment accounting for 17.4% of total employment. Small businesses and informal traders, particularly in townships and suburban areas, face critical challenges in generating consistent income. Research by the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) indicates that 70-80% of small businesses fail within the first five years, primarily due to lack of market access and customer visibility. 

Our primary research through surveys with 50 small business owners in Gauteng townships revealed that 68% struggle to reach customers beyond their immediate physical location, 54% experience unpredictable daily sales due to customers not knowing what inventory is available, and 72% report losing potential sales because customers default to larger retailers due to convenience. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this challenge, with 43% of small businesses reporting decreased foot traffic even as digital commerce grew by 66% nationally (according to World Wide Worx E-commerce Report 2023). 

Geographic distance creates psychological barriers - customers living just 2-3 kilometers away often don't visit local shops due to uncertainty about product availability and the inconvenience of physically checking multiple locations. Additionally, 61% of surveyed customers expressed willingness to buy from local businesses but cited lack of awareness about what's available nearby as the primary barrier. This results in small merchants losing an estimated 40-60% of potential local sales, directly impacting household incomes, contributing to economic instability, and weakening community economic resilience. The problem is particularly acute in townships where unemployment is highest and local economic circulation is most critical for community survival.

Small local businesses in our target communities struggle to generate consistent local demand because customers lack awareness of local inventory, geographic distance reduces purchase likelihood, and inconsistent product availability or inconvenient purchase flows prevent repeat buying; as result merchants lose sales, incomes are unstable, and local economic resilience is weakened.

## SOLUTION

Saknew Market is a mobile and web marketplace platform that connects local buyers with nearby small businesses in their communities. The solution works through three integrated mechanisms that address visibility, accessibility, and reliability challenges.

First, the platform increases inventory awareness through real-time product listings where sellers can showcase their products with photos, prices, and stock levels. A unique 24-hour "status update" feature, similar to WhatsApp or Instagram stories, allows sellers to post quick updates about new arrivals, special promotions, or available inventory without technical complexity. Customers can browse all local shops from their phones, search for specific products, and see exactly what's available before making purchase decisions.

Second, the platform reduces geographic friction through intelligent location-based sorting that automatically prioritizes showing customers products from shops within their immediate area (typically 5-10km radius). An integrated delivery management system allows sellers to coordinate deliveries with unique verification codes that protect both parties during handoff, eliminating the need for customers to physically visit shops while building trust in the transaction process.

Third, the platform ensures purchase reliability through real-time stock tracking that shows customers current availability, preventing wasted trips or disappointment. A wallet-based payment system eliminates checkout friction by allowing customers to pre-fund their accounts and complete purchases instantly without entering card details repeatedly. An escrow mechanism holds funds until delivery is confirmed, protecting both buyers and sellers. Comprehensive order tracking keeps customers informed from purchase to delivery, while sellers can manage their entire shop operations including inventory, promotions, and order fulfillment through an intuitive mobile interface.

Key features include: Shop profiles with product catalogs and contact information; Shopping cart and streamlined checkout; Order management with status tracking (pending, processing, ready for delivery, completed); Delivery verification with unique codes; Product reviews and ratings; Promotional discount system; Per-item order operations (cancel or verify individual items); and a social-commerce status update system for daily engagement.

The platform employs a local-first marketplace approach combining concierge merchant onboarding to seed inventory density, distance-aware discovery algorithms that surface nearby products first, and low-friction ordering flows. Sellers can post 24-hour status updates to advertise products, promotions, and direct links to listings, ensuring nearby customers see timely offers. The secure delivery-verification system uses single-use, time-limited codes tied to specific orders and buyers, validated server-side. Buyers must confirm receipt with the code before the platform releases payout to the seller, ensuring customers actually receive items while reducing fraud and protecting seller earnings through the escrow mechanism.

## CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

**Primary Customers (Sellers - Those Who Pay Commission):**

1. **Spaza Shop Owners** - Small convenience stores in townships selling groceries, household items, and basic goods. Typically operate from home or small premises, serve immediate neighborhood, need to compete with larger retailers.

2. **Home-Based Business Owners** - Entrepreneurs running businesses from home including bakers, caterers, seamstresses, beauty product sellers, and craft makers. Often women-led businesses, operate part-time or full-time, struggle with customer acquisition beyond word-of-mouth.

3. **Market Stall Vendors** - Traders operating at local markets, taxi ranks, or street corners selling clothing, accessories, electronics, or general merchandise. Face inconsistent foot traffic, need to reach customers on non-market days.

4. **Informal Traders** - Mobile vendors, door-to-door sellers, and informal retailers who lack permanent physical locations. Need a way to establish credibility and reach customers proactively.

5. **Small Retail Shop Owners** - Owners of small brick-and-mortar shops in suburban areas selling specialized products (beauty supplies, phone accessories, stationery, etc.). Face competition from malls and online retailers, need local customer base.

**Primary Users (Buyers - Those Who Purchase):**

1. **Young Working Professionals (Ages 25-40)** - Employed individuals living in townships or suburbs, comfortable with mobile technology, value convenience, want to support local businesses but lack time to physically shop around.

2. **Township Residents (Ages 18-55)** - Community members who prefer buying locally to support neighbors and keep money in the community, but need convenient way to discover what's available nearby.

3. **Budget-Conscious Shoppers** - Individuals seeking affordable products and willing to buy from local sellers if prices are competitive and process is convenient. Often compare prices across multiple shops.

4. **Students and Youth (Ages 18-25)** - Tech-savvy young people who prefer mobile shopping, active on social media, influence household purchasing decisions, appreciate social features like status updates.

5. **Parents and Homemakers** - Primary household shoppers looking for convenient ways to purchase daily necessities, groceries, and household items without leaving home or traveling far.

**Secondary Beneficiaries:**

1. **Delivery Service Providers** - Informal couriers or delivery persons who can earn income facilitating deliveries between sellers and buyers.

2. **Community Organizations** - Local business associations, stokvels, and community groups interested in strengthening local economic networks.

**Customer Prioritization Strategy:**

Our primary focus is on local shoppers and micro/informal merchants: everyday neighborhood buyers seeking fast, convenient access to nearby products, and small shop owners needing a low-friction mobile storefront with reliable order and payout tools. Secondary users include time-pressed commuters and deal-seekers who value speed and promotions. Tertiary segments cover formal small businesses (requiring advanced analytics and payout features), local couriers, and community organizers. We prioritize onboarding micro merchants and local shoppers first to build supply density and create marketplace traction before expanding to other segments.

## UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION

**For Small Business Owners:**
"Reach local customers effortlessly and grow your sales without expensive marketing or technical skills - just post your products and let nearby customers find you."

**For Local Shoppers:**
"Discover and buy from all your local shops in one place, support your community, and get convenient delivery - all from your phone."

**What Sets Us Apart:**

Saknew Market offers a hyperlocal marketplace experience specifically designed for South African township and suburban commerce, combining the convenience of modern e-commerce with the community trust of local shopping. Unlike national platforms like Takealot that prioritize large retailers and fast shipping from distant warehouses, we prioritize showing customers what's available within their immediate 5-10km radius, keeping money circulating in local communities. 

Our 24-hour status update feature provides a familiar, low-friction way for non-technical sellers to maintain an active online presence, similar to how they already use WhatsApp or Facebook, but within a structured marketplace that builds credibility. The delivery verification system with unique codes and escrow payments addresses the trust gap that prevents many local transactions, protecting both parties without requiring expensive logistics infrastructure.

We offer per-item order management recognizing that local deliveries may happen at different times from different shops, unlike traditional e-commerce that assumes single-warehouse fulfillment. Our commission rate of 5% is significantly lower than traditional retail margins (30-50%) or other platforms, making it accessible even for informal traders with thin margins. The platform is mobile-first, works on low-end smartphones, ensuring accessibility for our target market.

Most importantly, we're not just a technology platform - we're a community economic empowerment tool designed specifically for South African small business realities, with features, pricing, and support structures that recognize the unique challenges and opportunities of local commerce in our communities

"Saknew connects shoppers with nearby shops in real time, making it easy to discover local products, compare options, and buy from sellers in your neighborhood. For sellers, the app provides a complete storefront and order-management suite — multi-image product uploads, delivery-code confirmation, earnings tracking, and shop analytics — so businesses can sell, manage, and grow directly from their phones. Built for speed and local convenience, Saknew reduces delivery friction, promotes community commerce, and puts local inventory in customers’ pockets.".

## UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

**1. Deep Community Understanding and Trust**
We are not external investors or large corporations trying to enter the market - we are from the communities we serve and understand the cultural dynamics, trust mechanisms, and practical challenges that small businesses face in South African townships. This insider perspective allows us to design features that truly address real needs rather than imposing solutions that work elsewhere but fail locally.


**2. Hyperlocal Focus and Network Effects**
While large platforms like Takealot focus on national reach and compete on speed and selection, we focus exclusively on local commerce within specific communities. This creates strong network effects - the more local merchants and customers join in a specific area, the more valuable the platform becomes for everyone in that community. We're building neighborhood marketplaces, not competing with national retailers.

**3. Social Commerce Innovation**
Our 24-hour status update feature is unique in the South African e-commerce space, combining the engagement of social media with the structure of a marketplace. This feature leverages behaviors that small business owners already practice on WhatsApp and Facebook, making adoption natural and reducing the learning curve. No other local platform offers this combination.

**4. Seller-Friendly Economics**
Our 5% commission rate is significantly lower than traditional retail margins (30-50%), payment gateway fees (2-3% plus transaction fees), or other marketplace platforms (10-20%). This makes us accessible to even the smallest informal traders who operate on thin margins. We've designed our business model to be sustainable at this low rate through volume and efficiency.

**5. Trust and Security Infrastructure**
Our delivery verification system with unique codes and escrow payments directly addresses the trust gap that prevents many local online transactions. This is not just a feature - it's a fundamental enabler of local e-commerce in communities where trust is earned through personal relationships. We've built this into the core platform, not as an add-on.

**6. Early Mover Advantage in Hyperlocal**
While there are many e-commerce platforms in South Africa, very few focus specifically on hyperlocal township and suburban commerce with features designed for small informal traders. We're establishing first-mover advantage in this specific niche before larger players recognize the opportunity.

**7. Commitment to Social Impact**
We're not just building a business - we're building a tool for community economic empowerment. This mission alignment attracts support from impact investors, grants, government programs, and community organizations that wouldn't support purely profit-driven ventures. It also builds loyalty among merchants and customers who see us as partners in community development.

**8. Agility and Adaptability**
As a lean startup, we can iterate quickly based on user feedback, adapt to local needs, and implement features that larger, bureaucratic competitors cannot. We've already demonstrated this through rapid feature development and deployment cycles during our MVP phase.

Saknew stands out by being truly local-first: we seed neighborhoods via concierge onboarding to create instant supply density, surface distance‑aware product listings so buyers see the closest, most relevant inventory, and give sellers mobile‑native tools (fast multi‑image publishing, 24‑hour status ads, in‑app promotions and analytics) to run a storefront with minimal overhead. Trust and unit economics are built in — payouts are escrowed behind single‑use, time‑limited delivery codes that buyers provide to seller to confirm receipt, dramatically reducing fraud and disputes

**Total First Year Cost Structure: R617,000**

**Monthly Operating Costs (After Initial Setup):**
- Infrastructure: R2,500
- Marketing: R6,000
- Personnel: R12,000
- Services: R3,000
- **Total Monthly: R23,500**

**Break-Even Analysis:**
At 5% commission rate, need R470,000 in monthly transaction volume to cover R23,500 monthly costs. This equals approximately 940 transactions at R500 average order value, or about 31 transactions per day.

Cost structure: Budget for the MVP includes one‑time upfront spends (product development, UX/design, legal/compliance, and merchant onboarding materials) and recurring monthly costs (infrastructure and managed DB, media/CDN and bandwidth, monitoring/observability, CI/build services, payment processing fees, SMS/email for OTPs, analytics, and customer/merchant support and ops), plus marketing (local promotions, paid ads, referral incentives). Variable costs scale with GMV—payment/payout fees, storage/bandwidth, and support headcount—so track key cost drivers (CAC, monthly burn, infra cost per active user, support cost per order) and use efficiency levers (managed services, signed CDN, focused geo‑pilots, contractor onboarding) to control spend.
