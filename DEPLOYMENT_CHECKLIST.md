## What You Need for Proper Deployment

### 1. ‚úÖ Source Code Changes
- [x] Code changes made in `WalletDashboardScreen.tsx`
- [x] Changes committed to git
- [x] Changes pushed to GitHub main branch

### 2. ‚úÖ Netlify Configuration
- [x] `netlify.toml` configured correctly
- [x] Build command: `npm run build`
- [x] Publish directory: `dist`
- [x] Auto-deploy enabled on main branch

### 3. ‚è≥ Build Process (Automatic)
Netlify automatically:
1. Detects new commit on main branch
2. Runs `npm install`
3. Runs `npm run build` (which runs `expo export --platform web`)
4. Publishes `dist` folder to CDN
5. Updates live site

### 4. ‚è≥ Verification Steps

**Wait 2-3 minutes for build**, then:

1. **Check Build Status:**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/sites/saknew-makert/deploys
   - Verify latest deploy shows "Published"
   - Check build logs for errors

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   ```
   Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + Shift + R
   Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   ```

3. **Test Changes:**
   - Visit: https://saknew-makert.netlify.app
   - Login to your account
   - Go to Wallet section
   - Verify earnings show golden background
   - Check for trophy icons and "EARNED" badges

## Why Changes Might Not Appear

### Common Issues:

1. **Browser Cache**
   - Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Or: Clear browser cache completely

2. **CDN Cache**
   - Netlify CDN may take 1-2 minutes to propagate
   - Solution: Wait a few minutes

3. **Build Still Running**
   - Check: https://app.netlify.com/sites/saknew-makert/deploys
   - Solution: Wait for "Published" status

4. **Build Failed**
   - Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
   - Look for error messages
   - Fix errors and push again

## Manual Deployment (If Needed)

If auto-deploy isn't working:

### Option 1: Using the Script
```bash
cd saknew_frontend
deploy.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps
```bash
cd saknew_frontend
npm install
npx expo export --platform web
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy changes"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
cd saknew_frontend
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

---

## Current Deployment Info

**Build Command in netlify.toml:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"
