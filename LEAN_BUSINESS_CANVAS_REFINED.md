# Saknew Market - Lean Business Canvas (Refined)

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

According to the South African Quarterly Labour Force Survey (Q3 2023), the unemployment rate stands at 32.9%, with informal sector employment accounting for 17.4% of total employment. Small businesses and informal traders, particularly in townships and suburban areas, face critical challenges in generating consistent income. Research by the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) indicates that 70-80% of small businesses fail within the first five years, primarily due to lack of market access and customer visibility. 

Our primary research through surveys with 50 small business owners in Gauteng townships revealed that 68% struggle to reach customers beyond their immediate physical location, 54% experience unpredictable daily sales due to customers not knowing what inventory is available, and 72% report losing potential sales because customers default to larger retailers due to convenience. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this challenge, with 43% of small businesses reporting decreased foot traffic even as digital commerce grew by 66% nationally (according to World Wide Worx E-commerce Report 2023). 

Geographic distance creates psychological barriers - customers living just 2-3 kilometers away often don't visit local shops due to uncertainty about product availability and the inconvenience of physically checking multiple locations. Additionally, 61% of surveyed customers expressed willingness to buy from local businesses but cited lack of awareness about what's available nearby as the primary barrier. This results in small merchants losing an estimated 40-60% of potential local sales, directly impacting household incomes, contributing to economic instability, and weakening community economic resilience. The problem is particularly acute in townships where unemployment is highest and local economic circulation is most critical for community survival.

**Core Problem:** Small local businesses in our target communities struggle to generate consistent local demand because customers lack awareness of local inventory, geographic distance reduces purchase likelihood, and inconsistent product availability or inconvenient purchase flows prevent repeat buying; as result merchants lose sales, incomes are unstable, and local economic resilience is weakened.

## SOLUTION

Saknew Market is a mobile and web marketplace platform that connects local buyers with nearby small businesses in their communities through three integrated mechanisms:

**1. Inventory Awareness:** Real-time product listings where sellers showcase products with photos, prices, and stock levels. A unique 24-hour "status update" feature (similar to WhatsApp/Instagram stories) allows sellers to post quick updates about new arrivals, promotions, or available inventory without technical complexity.

**2. Geographic Accessibility:** Intelligent location-based sorting automatically prioritizes showing customers products from shops within their immediate area (5-10km radius). Integrated delivery management with unique verification codes protects both parties during handoff, eliminating the need for physical visits while building trust.

**3. Purchase Reliability:** Real-time stock tracking shows current availability. Wallet-based payment system eliminates checkout friction with pre-funded accounts and instant purchases. Escrow mechanism holds funds until delivery is confirmed. Comprehensive order tracking keeps customers informed from purchase to delivery.

**Key Features:** Shop profiles with product catalogs; Shopping cart and streamlined checkout; Order management with status tracking; Delivery verification with unique codes; Product reviews and ratings; Promotional discount system; Per-item order operations; Social-commerce status updates.

**Technical Approach:** The platform employs a local-first marketplace combining concierge merchant onboarding to seed inventory density, distance-aware discovery algorithms that surface nearby products first, and low-friction ordering flows. The secure delivery-verification system uses single-use, time-limited codes tied to specific orders and buyers, validated server-side. Buyers must confirm receipt with the code before the platform releases payout to the seller, ensuring customers actually receive items while reducing fraud and protecting seller earnings through the escrow mechanism.
